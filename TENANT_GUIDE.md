# 🏡 Tenant Guide – Documenting Noise or Party Disturbances

Simple, privacy‑safe steps for residents disturbed by loud or repeated parties.

---

## 1. Keep a Noise Log
Record each event with date, time, and description.

| Date | Time | Description | Impact | Action |
|------|------|-------------|---------|--------|
| 2025‑10‑23 | 11:50 PM | Loud music, shouting from Unit 5 | Couldn’t sleep | Emailed manager |

Stay factual—avoid opinions about neighbors personally.

---

## 2. Notify Management
Email or text the landlord after each major incident.

**Include:**  
- Date / time / duration  
- Short description  
- Optional 311 or police report #  
- Your contact info  

**Subject line suggestion:**  
> “Noise Disturbance – [Date] [Time] – [Unit #]”

---

## 3. Optional Supporting Evidence
- Short **video clips (10–30 s)** from inside your own unit showing sound levels.  
- **No footage of others’ private areas** and **no audio recording** conversations.  
- Save any texts or chats showing others experienced the same noise.

---

## 4. If Noise Persists
1. Continue your log.  
2. File a **311** or **non‑emergency police** report.  
3. Send incident number to management.  
4. Keep communications civil and written.

---

## 5. Privacy & Safety
- Never confront loud tenants directly.  
- Share complaints only with management or authorities.  
- Keep copies for 6–12 months in case follow‑up is needed.

---

**Remember:** Consistent, dated, factual reporting helps management resolve issues lawfully and restores quiet for everyone.
